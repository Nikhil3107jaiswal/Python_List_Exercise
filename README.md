# 🐍 Python List Exercises

This repository contains **completed Python List exercises** designed to strengthen understanding of **list operations, iteration, conditions, and built-in Python modules**. The assignment focuses on practical problem-solving using lists, which is a core requirement for Python, Data Analyst, and entry-level programming roles.

---

## 📌 Objective

To practice and demonstrate proficiency in **Python list manipulation** through a wide range of logical and real-world problems.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered

The assignment includes solutions for the following list-based concepts:

* Basic list operations (sum, product, min, max)
* Removing duplicates and checking empty lists
* Copying and cloning lists
* Filtering elements using conditions
* Finding common elements between lists
* Index-based operations using `enumerate`
* Odd and even number extraction
* Shuffling and random selection from lists
* List slicing and flattening nested lists
* Frequency counting using `Counter`
* List concatenation and combinations
* Permutations using `itertools`
* String and character list operations
* Advanced list logic (consecutive elements, circular lists)

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

* Python Lists
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Conditional logic
* Built-in functions (`sum`, `max`, `min`, `len`, `set`)
* Standard libraries (`random`, `itertools`, `collections`)
* Logical thinking and problem-solving
